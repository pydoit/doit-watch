# doit cmd plugin: **watch**

Watch filesystem and re-execute on changes.

# Status

This is the successor to the `doit auto` command.

It is based on [`watchfiles`](https://pypi.org/project/watchfiles) with support
from the [Notify](https://docs.rs/notify/latest/notify/) rust package.

For the version based on the previous `ipynotify` and `macfsevents` libraries, see [`doit-auto1`](https://github.com/pydoit/doit-auto1).
